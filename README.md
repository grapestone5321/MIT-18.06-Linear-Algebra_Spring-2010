## Readings

Strang, Gilbert. Introduction to Linear Algebra. 4th ed. Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780980232714.

Strang, Gilbert. Introduction to Linear Algebra. 5th ed. Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 2016. ISBN: 9780980232776.

## Course Highlights

This course parallels the combination of theory and applications in Professor Strangâ€™s textbook Introduction to Linear Algebra. 

The course picks out four key applications in the book: Graphs and Networks; Systems of Differential Equations; Least Squares and Projections; and Fourier Series and the Fast Fourier Transform.

## Course Description

This is a basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra. Emphasis is given to topics that will be useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, similarity, and positive definite matrices.

## Video Lectures

These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded live in the Fall of 1999. 

Support for the video production was provided by the Lord Foundation of Massachusetts under a grant to the MIT Center for Advanced Educational Services.
